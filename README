It is a plugin for pyload (http://pyload.org/).
A description of pyload can be found at https://bitbucket.org/spoob/pyload/raw/7dcc22c4b634/README.
Basically it is a software to automatically download from hosters like rapidshare.com and fileshare.com (for a list of supported hosters please read http://pyload.org/hoster)

It makes automatic call to the url: antigate.com/in.php using the apiKey to resolve captcha.
And it also calls antigate.com/in.php to obtain the results of the captcha and the available credits.
If a captcha is not accepted by the hoster a reclaim is made automatically.

Based on the pyload plugin for CaptchaTrader.com.

Install:
Move AntiGate.py in ~/.pyload/userplugins/hooks/ (~/.pyload being the default home for pyload).
Replace API_KEY by your api key from antigate.com.
